# Simon

## Description
I created this app as my first project for General Assembly. The app is meant to mimic the game the game 'Simon'. When the user presses 'Ready', the gameboard illuminates 3 lights in a random order. The user then clicks the lights in the same order. If the user clicks the lights in the correct order, they move on to the next level.

## Features
In addition to the basic game funtionality, I included:
    -A reset button for starting the game over
    -A button to speed the game up
    -A button to enter "Reverse Mode" where the user has to enter the sequence in the reverse order of how it's displayed on the screen

## Approach Taken
My goal was to first make the basic game features work. I did that by first writing simple HTML and CSS files. After that, I wrote pseudocode in broad steps for the JavaScript. I then elaborating on each of of those steps with further pseudocode. Once I had the psedocode, I wrote the vanilla JavaScript for each step, testing and debugging along the way. Once I had the basic functionality working, I styled the app and then finally added my additional features.

## Unsolved Problems
<<<<<<< HEAD
The biggest issue I can see with my app is when the user tries to click through their answer too fast. If they click quickly through their response, the sequence of clicks does not seem to be captured and the game does not advance.
