# Simon

## Description
I created this app as my first project for General Assembly. The app is meant to mimic the game the game 'Simon'. When the user presses 'Ready', the gameboard illuminates 3 lights in a random order. The user then clicks the lights in the same order. If the user clicks the lights in the correct order, they move on to the next level. The next level lights up the same 3 lights, and adds an additional 4th light and so on.

## Features
In addition to the basic game funtionality, I included:
    -A reset button for starting the game over
    -A button to speed the game up
    -A button to enter "Reverse Mode" where the user has to enter the sequence in the reverse order of how it's displayed on the screen
